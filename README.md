Shop-Guard: Shoplifting Detection System
Shop-Guard is a machine learning-based solution designed to enhance retail security by detecting suspicious activities such as shoplifting. Using a Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) model, this system analyzes spatial and temporal data from surveillance cameras to identify potential threats in real-time.

Features
Real-Time Detection: Processes live video streams to detect suspicious behavior.
Spatial-Temporal Analysis: Combines convolutional layers and LSTM units for understanding both spatial patterns (e.g., object movement) and temporal patterns (e.g., sequences of actions).
High Accuracy: Optimized for retail environments to minimize false positives and false negatives.
Customizable: Easily adaptable to various retail setups and surveillance camera configurations.
Architecture Overview
The Shop-Guard system uses a ConvLSTM-based model, which integrates convolutional operations for spatial feature extraction and LSTM units for capturing temporal dependencies. The key components include:

Input Processing: Accepts video frames as input.
ConvLSTM Layers: Extract spatial-temporal features for each frame sequence.
Classification Layer: Outputs a probability score for suspicious activity.
Output: Alerts for detected events.
Installation
Clone this repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/Shop-Guard.git
cd Shop-Guard
Install the required dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your environment:

Ensure access to a video surveillance system or sample datasets.
Configure the config.json file for your input and output settings.
Usage
Prepare Data: Organize your dataset of video sequences into appropriate folders (e.g., suspicious and normal).

Train the Model:

python train.py --config config.json
Modify the configuration file to adjust hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size).
Run the System:



python detect.py --video input_video.mp4
For batch evaluation:

python evaluate.py --dataset test_data/
Visualize Results:

Use the visualize.py script to view the detected activities in the video:

python visualize.py --results output.json
Dataset
Shop-Guard works well with video datasets that capture:

Customer behaviors in retail stores.
Suspicious activities such as loitering, hiding items, or unusual movement patterns.
Recommended datasets:

DCSASS Dataset: Contains real-world video sequences of crimes.
Your Custom Dataset: Annotate and label your own surveillance footage.
